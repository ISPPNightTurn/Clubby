#it contains a lot of information about them so you dhould check it out if you have been assigned testing...
# there is some info about coverage and selenium they are surely gonna ask us about so read upon it.

#This type of tests are unit tests but you can also test views:
#This is an example test
class YourTestClass(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Setup run before every test method.
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up run after every test method.
        pass

    def test_something_that_will_pass(self):
        self.assertFalse(False)

    def test_something_that_will_fail(self):
        self.assertTrue(False)





# these tests are part of the following tutorial:

# to work they need a change to the views beforehand.
